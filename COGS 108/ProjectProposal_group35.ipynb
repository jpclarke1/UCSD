These 3 variables are all thoughfully relate to and affected by walkable cities. We're going to focus on san diego for our project and look into different neighborhoods/cities and how they compare with those 3 variables. In some of the studies it also shows how there are relatinoships between these variables and walkability - like the relationship between walkability and air quality influencing health impacts, which can affect one's life expectancy.\n",

Walking is considered a safe training activity to improve cardiovascular health in general\n",
        "  -Associations between walkability and air pollution are not direct. More congested city centers tend to be more walkable but have higher air pollution and suburbs have low walkability and low air pollution, but the regions in the middle tend to have low air pollution and high walkability. Studies show that air pollution impacts the quality of health benefits achieved through walking, and other studies question the risks from exposure to particulate matters.\n",

It includes many variables from all of San Diego County's cities including life expectancy, air quality, and distances to community spaces. It has 962 rows and 61 columns total, which means we have a lot of variables to sift out. Because of its wealth of geographic observations, it would be interesting also to make a spatial map with this data. This dataset is basically the ideal because of all of the variables available to explore and the number of observations."
